    <div class="project">
      <h3>Educational Math Game (Java)</h3>
      <p>Designed and developed a Java-based math game for elementary-aged children that provides an engaging way to learn basic arithmetic operations. Created a user-friendly GUI interface and incorporated musical cues to provide feedback for correct and incorrect answers. Utilized object-oriented programming principles to ensure a well-structured and maintainable codebase. Implemented key features including high scores, multiple levels, and varying levels of difficulty to enhance user engagement and learning outcomes. Demonstrated proficiency of key object-oriented principles via the use of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in the program.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Artificial Intelligence Facial Landmark Detection Project</h3>
      <p>Completed a Python project for an artificial intelligence course that utilized computer vision techniques to detect facial features on a professor's face and detail points of interest. Used convolutional neural networks, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), alongside deep learning technologies like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and Active Shape Models (ASM) to help generate potential points of interest for recognition of facial features, such as dimples or cheekbones. Successfully achieved high accuracy in identifying and locating facial features on the professor's face, demonstrating strong proficiency in computer vision and deep learning techniques.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Movie Guide Application</h3>
      <p>Developed a movie guide web application using JavaScript and the Open Movie Database API (OMDB). Allows users to search for a film to watch by genre, actor, and year of release. Gathers data from the website IMDB to provide detailed information on each movie.</p>
